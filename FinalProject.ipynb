    "# Predicting NFL Super Bowl Champion\n",

    "Football, that is American Football, is one of the most popular sports in the world. You can find fans of the sport all over the world, and even leagues of teams. You can find [teams](https://insider.afca.com/american-football-continues-global-international-growth/) in Austria, Cananda, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Australia, and Germany. As you can see, there are many leagues across the world. However, the league that represents the peak of football is the [National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League), or as most people know it, the NFL. \n",
    "\n",
    "In football, like any other sport, you win or lose. In the NFL, winning is everything. All 32 teams share a common goal: to win the Super Bowl.  The Super Bowl is essentially the NFL's championship game. It has become almost like a holiday in the United States. The day of the Super Bowl, which is on a Sunday in February, the nation pauses to watch one game. People gather anywhere and everywhere, with their eyes glued to the TV. An estimated 96.4 million people watched the Super Bowl in February 2021. In short, the Super Bowl is a very big deal, especially in the United States. To reach the Super Bowl, 12-14 teams (the [format changed](https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nfl/news/nfl-playoff-bracket-format-explained/7h99ce2e8u7r1jyc0pcku3be7) to 14 teams starting this season) compete in a single-elimination playoff. These 14 teams and the playoff matchups are decided by a 16-game regular season. My goal for this tutorial is to try and predict the Super Bowl winner, based off this 16-game regular season."
